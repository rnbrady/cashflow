# Next.js rules

- Use the App Router structure with `page.tsx` files in route directories.
- Client components must be explicitly marked with `'use client'` at the top of the file.
- Use kebab-case for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-form`) and PascalCase for component files.
- Prefer named exports over default exports, i.e. `export function Button() { /* ... */ }` instead of `export default function Button() { /* ... */ }`.
