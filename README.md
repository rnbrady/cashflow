# Cashflow

[Cashflow](https//cashflow.dev) is a Bitcoin Cash transaction explorer which displays the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of transactions. It connects to a [Chaingraph](https://chaingraph.cash/) backend to fetch transactions with information about parent and child transactions.

Cashflow is built with the excellent [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) library and uses the [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) framework.

Cashflow is open source. To run the development server locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
